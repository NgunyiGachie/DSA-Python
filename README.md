## Data Structures

1. **Linked List**: Implementation of singly linked list, doubly linked list, etc.
2. **Stack**: Implementation of stack data structure.
3. **Queue**: Implementation of queue data structure.
4. **Binary Tree**: Implementation of binary tree data structure.
5. **Heap**: Implementation of heap data structure.
6. **Hash Table**: Implementation of hash table (hash map) data structure.
7. **Graph**: Implementation of graph data structure.

## Algorithms

1. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Heap Sort
   - Recursion
   - Shell Sort

2. **Algorithms for Searching Strings**:
   - Linear Search: Simple approach where you check each character or substring sequentially.
   - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm: Efficient algorithm for substring searching that avoids unnecessary character comparisons.
   - Boyer-Moore Algorithm: Another efficient algorithm for substring searching, focusing on skipping characters based on a preprocessing step.
   - Rabin-Karp Algorithm: Uses hashing to find one or more patterns in a text string.
